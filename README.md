# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Regression

This project predicts house prices based on various housing features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and facilities like air conditioning, basement, etc.

The goal of this project is to build a regression-based machine learning model that can estimate the price of a house from given input features.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

---

## 🚀 Machine Learning Model

The regression model is trained using:

- Linear Regression  
(Optional: Random Forest Regressor for better accuracy)

---

## 📊 Data Visualization

The following graphs are used for analysis:

- Price Distribution Histogram  
- Area vs Price Scatter Plot  
- Actual vs Predicted Price Plot  
- Residual Error Plot  

These plots help in understanding model performance and data trends.

## 🏗️ Project Workflow

1. Load the CSV dataset  
2. Data preprocessing (handling categorical values)  
3. Train-Test split  
4. Model training using regression  
5. Prediction on test data  
6. Performance evaluation (R² Score, MAE, RMSE)  
7. Visualization of results
